Tonight during the flight to Hawaii I read the magzine titled "science of relationships" from Times. And the two chapters I read tonights are about romantic relationship and the friendship. The main motivation I spend time and money on this magzine is I realize that I should not take any good relationship for granted, especially my current relationships. 

One thing I read and I am also doing is constantly complement your partner. 

Another thing I already know, and get confirmed about the romantic relationship is that you should not always be right about some thing. Do not be angry to your partner and shout out. Instead, manage your temper: "keep your mouth shut and do not act out".

Finally, sex is also an important part of the relationship. And the recommended frequency is once a week in average. Do more exercie if needed. 

Compared with romantic relationship, I did not realize the imporantance of friendship. I know it is importantant but I thought it can be replaceable. After reading the magzine, I learnt that it is important to your physical and mental health especially when you are old. The number of friends you need are 3-5, as you can only keep about 15 people in your close relationship. Minus your relatives/kin, 3-5 is a reasonable number. 

There are three types of friends that you can have, the people you can talk to, you can rely on, and you can have fun with. 

The common property about romantic relationship and friendship is you need to spend time and connection. So start to invite friends into activities, and do not let the relationship to cool down.
