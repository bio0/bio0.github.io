# Happyness formula

happyness = what you have / what you want

Working on what you have is hard, try to work on the denominator

Three factors of happyness: enjoyment, satisfaction, and purpose
- satisfaction: its your reward for striving, for working, for even suffering

How to find purpose?

You need to answer, or try to find the answer of the following two questions:
- why am i alive
- for what I'm willing to die

It is hard to answer the second question, but let's try to find the answer for the first question.

Why am I alive?

To experience, to learn.

To experience different aspects of the world and as a human.

To learn the knowledge and skills with which I can help SOME others, influence others.

# Social Network
social network is like the junk food of social life. 
Spending time on social network is like eating chips. 

Spend max 30 mins a day across all social network platforms, and focus more on face to face social life.

- Here I need to improve as I do not have enough face to face social life.

# Death and Fear
Beat fear by experiencing fear and making it ordinary.

# Here and Now
Don't be a time traveler, thinking about the past and the future.

In average a person spend 30-50% of the time thinking about the future.

Just be mindful of here and now, experiencing your life, live your current life well.

# 无常 (impermanence)
- nothing lasts and it doesn't matter
- every emotion has an equilibrium
- make smarter decisions on the upside
- worry less on the downside

# How to do the above, and do it better
- think about it
- make it as a habit
- go share it, and you will never lose it
