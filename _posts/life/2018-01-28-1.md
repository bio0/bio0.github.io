A grandfather is talking with his grandson and he says there are two wolves inside of us which are always at war with each other. 

One of them is a good wolf which represents things like kindness, bravery and love. The other is a bad wolf, which represents things like greed, hatred and fear.

The grandson stops and thinks about it for a second then he looks up at his grandfather and says, “Grandfather, which one wins?”

The grandfather quietly replies, **the one you feed** 

而Tal在《幸福课》（Positive Psychology）中也一再强调，要多关注自己的优点。自己的优点就像是一棵棵小树，关注它你才回去浇灌它，浇灌它，它才能成长。如果你把自己的精力都放在自己的缺点上，而不去浇灌优点，那你的优点就会慢慢枯萎。
