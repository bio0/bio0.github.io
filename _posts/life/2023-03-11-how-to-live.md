# Learn Better

How I want to live the rest of my life?

## live it wisely
I want to live it wisely. I need to continue learn new techniques and philosophy so I can be a wise man and live my life wisely. Some example of using my time:

### Architect of Time

Allocate the time when you have most of the energy to the task that means most to you. All times are equal, some time are more important than others.

This is something I reviewed today in the writing course on Coursera.

To live it wisely, I need to think about what are the important aspects my life (so I can allocate time to them, and so I can put more focus on them.)

## live it fully
I want to live it fully. I want to live my life fully with more awareness and less auto pilot. I may need to employ more meditation techniques. 

## make some difference/influence
I want to make some difference to the world, or as Kaifu Lee said, he want to max his influence to the world.
