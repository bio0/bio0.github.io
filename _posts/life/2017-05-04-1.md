上次谈到我对生活的想法，即平淡而夹杂pain。

So I decided to not "use" gaming, video (I mean those small and quick videos on youtube) to stimulate and make me happy. Simply because it is not real.

And another change I want to introduce is to read novels. There are mainly two reasons of doing this. First, I am still a person, and I need replacement to fill the blank by leaving games and videos. So I choose novels and fictions, because it is more plain. And it works: today when I want some stimulation, I choose to read several pages of Kafka on the Shore to evade. And it works.

The next reason is that I want to introduce some peace and beauty into my life. I really need them. So that I can find a place where I can hide.

I choose to start from some Chinese version of Haruki Murakami, maybe later I can change to English version? If I really want to read related.

I choose this because I really want to enjoy, instead of learning. I can not learn all the time. I accept myself as a human.
