This is to test how to add image into Jekyll based github blog.

Note, all `test` folders will be ignored. 

The following two all works, we should pick the second one as it is easy
- Option 1
`![King's Cayan1]({{site.url}}/images/test.jpeg)`
![King's Cayan1]({{site.url}}/images/test.jpeg)

- Option 2
`![King's Cayan2](/images/compressed-test.jpg)`
![King's Cayan2](/images/compressed-test.jpg)

- Option 3
This is not working
`![King's Cayan3](../../images/test.jpeg)`
![King's Cayan3](../../images/test.jpeg)
