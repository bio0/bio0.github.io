Whale watching at Mori Point today. We got lucky: a whale surfaced close enough to see its back and dorsal fin, then blew a misty plume.

Seabirds dotted the water—some circling, others plunge-diving for fish. It felt like an all-you-can-eat ocean buffet.

According to ChatGPT, it was probably a humpback, feeding on sardines.

I love this scenery. The ocean abides - it's there whether we show up or not, whether it crosses our mind or not.
