# Interleave

If information is studied so that it can be interpreted in relation to other things in your memory, learning is much more powerful.

Make sure the mini-skills you interleave are related in some higher-order way. If you're trying to learn tennis, you'd want to interleave serves, backhands, volleys, smashes, and footwork -- not serves, synchronized swimming, European capitals, and programming in Java.

Compared to massed practice, a significant advantage of interleaving and variation is that they help us learn better how to assess context and discriminate between problems, selecting and applying the correct solution from a range of possibilities.
