# 习作
Some people believe that there is no future for public transport, because travelling by car is so much more convenient.

I do not agree that three is no future for public transport. One of the direct reason is that I do not even agree with the argument that travelling by car is always convenient than public transport. There are many kinds of transport, like buses, railway and flight. First, distance matters. If you want to travel to a town nearby, it might be convenient for you to drive your own car than to waiting for a bus. However, if you are planning a business travel from New York to Los Angles, it would sounds stupid to drive a car unless you do not care about time. Second, private transport may not be available to everyone. In some developing country, like China where not every person can afford a car, public transport is always the best choice for ordinary people. Third, by car is not always the fastest way. The speed of a car is usually limited to 80 miles per hour on highway, not mentioned that you have to go through some cities where the speed limit is around 40 miles per hour. While high-speed railway can achieves 160 miles per hour, which can save your time and energy. Finally, not every one like driving, I always like sitting there in some public transport, listening to some music instead of keeping alert for driving.

Even though travelling by car is much more convenient in some certain area or for some certain conditions, there is still needs for public transport. One problem of driving cars is air pollution, while public transport can help reduce such pollution. Another problem is restriction by policy. Take Beijing for instance, even if you have a car, you can not use it in certain days in one week, because the road is so crowd.
