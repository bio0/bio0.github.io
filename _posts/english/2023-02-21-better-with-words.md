# Comma
## Comma splice
You can not use comma to directly connect two sentences.

> I really appreciate your willingness to help, I'm excited to get more feedback from you.

Here comma need to be something stronger: `.`, or maybe `;`

# However
Same as the above, you can not use a `,` before however.
Between two independent clauses. 

Before `However`, it is always right to use `;`, but some people do not like `.` before However. 
Some boss does not like you to start a sentence with `However`.

# Conjunctions

## Adverbial Conjunctions
`However` is adverbial conjunction.

```
Moreover, Instead, Otherwise, Therefore
```
You can start a sentence with `Moreover`, `Instead` et al

- when an adverbial conjunction connects two independent clauses in one sentence, it is preceded by a semicolon and followed by a comma.
- if an adverbial conjunction is used in any other position in a sentence, it is set of by commas.

## Coordinating Conjunctions
```
FANBOYS: for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so
```

- when you have two **independent** clauses connected by a coordinating conjunction, it is generally a good idea to include a comma.
