In most recent projects, we need to deliver under tight timeline. What I found useful:

# Communication, Communication, Communication
## Timeline 
If you are given a concrete timeline, explicitly from the leaders, good, don't push back immediately. Instead, give the leadership an impression that you can do it 

1.  break down the tasks into sub-tasks. Create tickets for the sub-tasks if you got to manage the work. Assign them to concrete people and make sure you can find concrete people. If you can't find the right POC, ask for help to identify the right POC. Get acknowledge from the POC that they will work on it. Get timeline , ETA, from the POC. Get acknowledge from the POC that they know the priority of the task. Get help so the POC can work on it with the right priority.
2. work backwards from the hard timeline and assign timeline to each subtask, based on their dependencies. 

If you are asked to provide a concrete timeline, try to provide a reasonable timeline. If you don't know the size of a subtask, give a range (1-4 weeks ðŸ˜„ for example)

I saw two forms of presenting the timeline, use a spreadsheet or use a table in doc.

### Spreadsheet
I used spreadsheet when I am asked to give timeline and progress of an eval project that others depend on. It can be considered as a infra work that the main project depend on.

The benefit of using spreadsheet is its conciseness. You can include more information (columns) in the spreadsheet: 
- project name
- status
- subtask
- ETA
- POC
- brief description

The downside is, it takes time to maintain certain format of the spreadsheet. Maybe there are commands or AI tools that can help with it. Another cons is, unlike google doc, the comments are not explicitly listed in the side panel, and leaders may not like it as they can't see the comments explicitly.

### Google Doc
Unlike spreadsheet, Google Doc has a very limit width that restricts the number of columns you can put. Some most important columns. I see one of the L6 uses this form instead. I also use this in my quarter or month planning, especially useful if I need to work on multiple projects.

- project name
- project description (include concrete design doc)
- project size (this is an estimation of the size, give concrete weeks or days)
- POC (not needed if this is for my own planning ðŸ˜†)
- Priority 

The benefit is you can include more detailed information in the project description. You can also put words before and after the table for context.

Another benefit is people can comment. It's also more readable. One extra benefit is it can be placed together with a design doc.

In general, I think this is more useful. People don't like reading spreadsheet and comment on it. At the end of the day, it also come down to the preference of the leadership!

### Leadership

If you are leading a project, or if you are mentoring people working on projects, you should also ask them to create a design or just a timeline doc like this.

## Update progress
### Daily
Create a running doc that contains concrete daily update, what works, what doesn't work, what you are blocked, what you plan to do, what are the priorities you considered of the task. Tag people on the corresponding items, ask their opinions, ask for help (cc leaders who can make sure they can help).

If you have a close collaborator, sync with them offline or in a quick meeting to get updates, ask them details, and summarize for them if they are your mentees, or summarize and give updates if you are the project leader.

### Weekly
Create a running doc that contains weekly update for leaders, managers who are not directly involved in the project in a daily base. Keep them on bullet point format.

### Quarterly
Create a running doc that contains quarterly planning and summarization with your direct manager or who you want to up-manage.

# Stand ups and meetings
Knows who are there in the meeting. Know each person's role and what should be involved with them. If there are high level leaders, don't discuss concrete problems in the meeting, call out progress instead, and maybe mention timelines. 

Try to resolve issues offline, instead of putting everything in the standup.
