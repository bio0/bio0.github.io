Some learning of recent project management:

# Goal
- clear communication with managers

- get all the dependencies written down

# Methods

- clear milestones, priorities, and timeline
  - clear communication with the managers

Especially when the project is large with multiple milestones, when you can not speed it up, you need to break it down and show a clear roadmap. This is a valuable skill based on my previous experience.

The milestones don't have to be precise. It can change with a reason, and it is also about clear communication when there is dependencies.

  - get clear with the dependencies when you write them down and collect all the ETAs 

It forces you to reach out to dependencies and get the ETAs.

You, or the PM can help you, track the progress of the dependencies and blockers.
It is also easier to articulate the timeline or delays. 

  - get clear with the priorities

Milestones also means priorities.
When you have a written table, it is much easier for you to communicate the priorities with the leaders.

# Presentation
- Create tables and figures for better communication each time you have stand up or meetings with the leaders.

- Pay attention to the leaders showing in the meeting. Make sure they have enough background of what you are presenting.
