- If you find some issue, especially at the very beginning, exam carefully. At first I find some cracks in front of the garage, but after careful check of the video recording, I noticed that it is not even caused by them.
- I was told, even if there are small issues, don't be mad at the workers. Try to maintain good relationship with them especially when they didn't start much work yet. If they are mad, they won't do the job with good quality.
- Ask them to explain the project. If you understand the basic, you can help spot potential issues. For instance, the slope was not good but I thought they will fix it in certain step. I made some wrong assumptions.
- If you spot issue, try to quantify instead of just "I feel".
