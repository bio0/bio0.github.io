I frequently encounter the issue of being given tight timelines with many dependencies.

It's hard to manage the dependencies, especially when some of them are internal. What do I mean? The PM leads the project, and I am working on component A. A contains A1, A2, and A3. The delivery of A1 actually depends on the PM delivering B1, but they can't provide it to me.

There are several reasons for this, with the main reason being that A is not a high priority, but they can't communicate this clearly. They can't admit that it has low priority.

What can I do? I should create a document listing all the tasks and their dependencies, making it clear that if we want to deliver A1 by a certain date, we need B1 by a certain date. Or, at least state that to get A1, we need B1 plus one week.

We need this kind of document for every project whenever there is pressure.
