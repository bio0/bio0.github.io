# Advices

Today I got some advice from a L7 and my former mentor.

- Sustainable: find your work patten where you can deliver and also make sure it is sustainable. Do not frequently burn out.

- Do not act as firefighter, find the long term goal for your team, or yourself. Josh didn't do well in the above two, not sustainable and break his health; also constantly be a firefighter instead of thinking about building the team, relying on others and instead spend more time thinking about the long term goal.

- Be proactive and have ownership. For low level, you can negotiate with the TL and manager to try to own something, design and propose. Now it is much easier to onboard yourself, youtube, bilibili, viber code.

- Be vocal. Speak during meetings.

Spend one week on a design that looks good, and start with prototyping in several weeks. Communicate with leaders.

# Thoughts
- let's try these advice and see

- let's don't run away from the bay area and the elite team and try to learn as much as possible if you can.
