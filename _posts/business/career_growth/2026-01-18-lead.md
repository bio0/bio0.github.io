# Advices

Today I got some advice from a Director and my skip on leading project.

1. Learn how to present the project progress. Not something like "oh... we can't do this, we can't do that, we have difficulty in blabla", but something like "in this amount of time, we can do X, and we plan to do Y as follow up effort, we also explored Z"

2. Similar as above, learn to negotiate. Not directly accept or directly reject, but something like I think we can do this ...

3. Build 1:1 relationship with stakeholders for each important project. E.g. in this project, you should connect 1:1 with senior staff

4. Increase visibality

# Thoughts

- Let's improve the project communication, especially the progress of the project... Similar to what A (whole project TL) has done, let's announce the progress, not just the issues or questions.
