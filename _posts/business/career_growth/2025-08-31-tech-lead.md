# What
What does a tech lead job covers?

Some learnings when I watch a L6: 
- Think though to make sure the project can work E2E
- If there is a component missing, find resources. For instance, if the frontend/UI is missing, or if the backend is missing, I should talk to team who is willing to commit to work on frontend or backend. I should also monitor to see if they really do what they promised.
- For a new project, create a quick demo in a short time. This can create momentum for the project. Sometimes it's faster to achieve something if people are forced to do this in a short time. And you should make sure this is in a short time.

I consider myself as tech lead for backend in this specific project.
What should a tech lead do?
- Drive major designs
- Review designs
- Review code
- Drive meetings, track progress
- Contribute ideas for model quality improvement, join discussions
