I am in my L5 and I need to grow to the next level.

How to grow to the next level? I think at X it's hard for me to find this kind of opportunity, where you need to have the project that can give you opportunity to grow. Meanwhile, X can give me opportunity to learn and grow in my tech, and if it there are opportunities to grow in the area of large project, it will be better.

What's needed to the next level? I need to start to think for the team. I need to check exactly what's needed in X.

But I don't need to be the next level at X. I just need to make sure my salary is in the next level. And My target is 500k to 600k.

I am not like do something very quick, but need to think about what needs to be done, project level, and cross project level, like when I am working on one project, I can think about what I can do for the next project after two quarters. I can try to foresee one or two quarters and write my thought down.

I think a mid size company like snowflake or figma can fit, (from A) basically you need the opportunity but you should make sure there is still some one who can and willing to mentor you.

I think I need to further improve my leadership so that it's not my short board. I need to write more (blog) and speak more (youtube, exploring more). I need to further improve my tech skills and problem solving skills.

One skill I need to enhance: pay full attention to what the leaders need and what's the top priority. Don't miss anything and you also need to dig out what they didn't explicitly say.

Next:
- interview after another one or two quarters
