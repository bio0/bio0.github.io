* director has very limited energy to focus on your project
* they have limited time to receive information and then fill the rest of the gaps
* you don't want to give the wrong impression that you don't know what you are doing or you are very slow in progress
* report the progress in a very positive manner, unless you have other purpose
* then talk about what time you need to make extra progress
* in weekly report, also just think about and highlight the progress, not just technical progress, alignment and design progress are also great progress
