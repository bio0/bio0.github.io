# Dos
- in the project description, you should focus on the difficulties of the project
  - how urgent the deadline is
  - how many obstacles there are
    - lack of staff
    - lack of A, B, C to launch
  - how many communications we need to make
  - just how bad the situation is when we get started
- in the result/contribution/impact section, shows how good the project is now
  - the pouch line is with all the difficulties, we launched the project on time
  - the project impact is what
  - how popular is the project
  - how many times your pipeline is used
  - how many people are using the pipeline
  - how much time or money you saved
- be precise, not be fluff (overloaded with adjectives but lacking specifics and substance)
  - because these words can be in anyone's promo doc
  - it's the detailed project that makes you specific
- focus on the first major two or three projects
  - after reading the first two major projects, committee will have a judgement that, 1) OK, TC should be promoted, and the rest just support my decision; 2) OK I am still not very sure, and maybe the rest can change my mind? In both cases, just don't leave any holes or attack points in the rest minor projects.
  - If it's the last scenario, 3) where the committee think I won't promo this TC, do you think the rest small projects can change the committee's mind? so focus on major projects but don't leave holes in minor projects

# Don'ts
- don't mention that you need to work through weekends and nights, and holidays
  - the punch line should be how you reuse xxx to quickly achieve it, how you change existing tool to quick achieve it, or how you organize xxx people to quickly achieve it

- do not repeat, otherwise it seems you don't have things to say

- don't leave holes or attack points in each project, major or minor
