Is it still worth learning writing given that ChatGPT is so powerful? 

Before answering the above question, it is helpful to answer this question first: do you still need to write when ChatGPT can replace many writing work?

For me, I see the following benefits of writing:
1. helps me clear my mind and helps me think more logically. There is a clear reasoning process.

2. it is a summary process and helps me review what I learnt and helps me memorize and understand things better.

For the above two, I can't ask ChatGPT to help me do it. So ChatGPT can not replace my writing effort.

The next question is do you still need to learn writing and editing? ChatGPT can help organize and add favor into the writing, besides what Grammarly can offer about grammar fixing. So it is less important to memorize the detailed grammar rules as long as other people can understand the document.

So also make it an art of your writing with your own style. And make writing my habit.
