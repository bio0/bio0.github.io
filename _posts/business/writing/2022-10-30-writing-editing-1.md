## Intro: Making You More Persuasive

### How to Learn
- Vocabulary/Term
  - terms, use them
    - explain to friends a concept 
    - to see if you sufficiently understand it yourself

- Low-Stakes Practice
  - Nobody improves just by staring at a screen
  - The point is to create a space for yourself that is free of judgment, consequence, or anything else that may make you anxious about putting words down on a page.
  - Without low-stakes practice, it is tough to achieve long-term growth.

- High-Stakes Projects
  - A big goal like finishing a paper, submitting a proposal, or applying for a job or promotion can be helpfully motivating. 
  - It can also give you a chance to bring together—in a holistic, meaningful way—all the skills you are about to start developing.
