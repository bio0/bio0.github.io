Here document two points I learnt from recent short wechat videos that I think make perfect sense.

1. Don't just live in the comfort zone

If you feel like you can not stand the arguments during work and want to avoid it to go to the comfort zone. Then your comfort zone will shrink from time to time. 

I think this level of argument is light and I need to grow from this level of argument.

His feedback is sugarcoated, I don't want to see him again.
He critisize me, I don't want to see him again.
I am not comfortable to do this job, I feel pain about it. I don't do it anymore.

2. Dance with chains

Can not find the video, but it is from some chinese entrepreneur. If you want to make some achievement, then you should learn to dance with chains. There will be various different bumpers, blockers, 小人 et al. 

3. failure

- 王立群：人要敢于面对失败。胜败乃兵家常事。鹿死谁手，犹未可知。可以被打败，不可以被打垮。
