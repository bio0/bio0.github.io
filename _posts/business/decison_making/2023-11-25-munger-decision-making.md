# Important Points
- There is no magic formula or easy recipe for instant wealth

# Investing Principles Checklist

## Risk
- **All investment eval should begin by measuring risk, especially reputational**
- Incorporate an appropriate margin of safety
- Avoid dealing with people of questionable character
- Insist upon proper compensation for risk assumed
- Always beware of inflation and interest rate exposures
- Avoid big mistakes; shun permanent capital loss

## Independence
- **Only in fairy tales are emperors told they are naked**
- Objectivity and rationality require independence of thought
- Remember that just because other people agree or disagree with you doesn't make you right or wrong -- the only thing that matters is the correctness of your analysis and judgement
- Mimicking the herd invites regression to the mean (merely average performance)
  * wait... but for investing we just want to get to the mean VTI ...
  * VTI is not the mean of people

## Preparation
- **The only way to win is to work, work, work, work, and hope to have a few insights**
- Develop into a lifelong self-learner through voracious reading; cultivate curiosity and strive to become a little wiser every day
- More important than the will to win is the will to prepare
- Develop fluency in mental models from the major academic disciplines
- If you want to get smart, the question you have to keep asking is "why, why, why?"

## Intellectual humility
- **Acknowledging what you don't know is the dawning of wisdom**
- Stay within a well-defined circle of competence
- Identify and reconcile disconfirming evidence
- Resist the craving for false precision, false certainties, etc
- Above all, never fool yourself, and remember that you are the easiest person to fool

## Analytic rigor
- **Use of the scientific method and effective checklists minimizes errors and omissions**
- Determine value apart from price; progress apart from activity; wealth apart from size
- It is better to remember the obvious than to grasp the esoteric
- Be a business analyst, mot a market, macroeconomic, or security analyst
- Consider totality of risk and effect; look always at potential second order and higher level impacts
- Think forwards and backwards -- Invert, always invert

## Allocation
- **Proper allocation of capital is an investor's number one job**
- Remember that highest and best use is always measured by the next best use (opportunity cost)
- Good ideas are rare--when the odds are greatly in your favor, bet (allocate) heavily
- Don't "fall in love" with an investment--be situation-dependent and opportunity-driven

## Patience
- **Resist the nature human bias to act**
- "Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world" (Einstein); never interrupt it unnecessarily
- Avoid unnecessary transactional taxes and frictional costs; never take action for its own sake
- Be alert for the arrival of luck
- Enjoy the process along with the proceeds, because the process is where you live

## Decisiveness
- **When proper circumstances present themselves, act with decisiveness and conviction**
- Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful
- Opportunity doesn't come often, so seize it when it does
- Opportunity meeting the prepared mind: that's the game

## Change
- **Live with change and accept unremovable complexity**
- Recognize and adapt to the true nature of the world around you; don't expect it to adapt to you
- Continually challenge and willingly amend your "best-loved ideas"
- Recognize reality even when you don't like it--especially when you don't like it

## Focus
- **Keep things simple and remember what you set out to do**
- Remember that reputation and integrity are your most valuable assets -- and can be lost in a heartbeat
- Guard against the effects of hubris and boredom
- Don't overlook the obvious by drowning in minutiae
- Be careful to exclude unneeded info or slop: "A small leak can sink a great ship"
- Face your big troubles; don't sweep them under the rug
