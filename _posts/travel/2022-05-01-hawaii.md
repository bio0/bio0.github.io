 Here I take a record of some random thoughts during and after the Hawaii trip.

 - Need to record the thoughts between each financial decision. For instance, which stock to buy/sell(like the decisions with MSFT or Meta or Nvidia). Or which stock you want to buy or sell(like the decision with Pacbio)

 - Need to take advantage of the time and freedom I have at G for the next two years by spending more time on the fitness and fundmental learning. 

 - Need to write more, even just one sentence or one paragraph. The github blog system is convenient enought for you to write short paragraph.
