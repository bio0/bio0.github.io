Topic: describe a trip, and highlight the chinese garden. 

Today ends the short trip to LA. And the last is the best. We went to the Huntington Botanical Gardens. It is definitely larger than the San Francisco Botanical Garden, and contains special views.

The highlighted gardens I like most are the desert garden, the japanese garden, and the chinese garden. 

The desert garden contains a lot of desert plants that I rarely have chance to encounter before. A variaty of cactus with different color and shape: like the postcard on the right corner of my desk.

The second garden we visited is the japanese garden.
I've been to many japanese gardens before. And I always like the view.

But my favorite is the chinese garden. It makes me homesick, and it is so authentic. I took a lot of pictures there. And what ends the journey well is I also had a american-chinese lunch there, with chinese style creek around us. It was really a great experience.
