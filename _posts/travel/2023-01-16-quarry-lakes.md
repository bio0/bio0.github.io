How long have you not seen a blue sky with green grassland? For me it has been almost two weeks. It was always raining these days until today. And I feel lucky that I decided to go out for a hiking. We originally decided to visit the Coyote Hills but it was closed, probably due to the flood as it is the Bay. As a result, we went to the Quarry Lakes as an alternative as it is close to Coyote Hills. 

It is a wise and lucky decision. The Quarry Lakes is more beautiful than I expected. I used to live very close to the park but did not had the chance to visit it. The main obstacle is I am afraid of the security in the park. I visited about five years ago in the dry season. And the lakes is very ugly with yellow, dead grass. The fence is shabby and I am quite worried that this park is abandoned.

When I arrived there, I was amazed. Fremont is a gorgeous place during rain season. The park contains three lacks, the Horseshoe Lake, the Rainbow Lake, and the Lago Los Osos (Lago means lake, pool). It was sometimes sunny and sometimes cloudy. When the sky is blue, the lake is blue; when the sky is cloudy, the lake is dark, really dark. It is really beautiful when it is sunny. It was green everywhere as all the land around the lake and on the island inside the lake are full of grass sprouts. I went immediately on to the grassland to feel the walking on it. It is soft, but not soft as I expected like walking on the meadows. I think it is because there were only short grass sprouts.

There are people fishing there. The park charges people if they want to go fishing in the Horseshoe Lake, so I suppose there are plenty of fish in the lack. Why the lake is called Horseshoe, because the size of the lake. In the lake there are a lot of pelicans, around twenty to thirty. I never seen so many pelicans at once before, even in the ShoreLake park. I also saw a baby coyote, not in Coyote Hill. The baby coyote is even smaller than the one I saw in Mission Peak. I also hear bird singing. The wildlife is really rich. 

I see BBQ sites in the entrance area of the park. Upon seeing them, I immediately imaging eating BBQ in my brain, thought nobody is BBQ there. 

It is a great lake, during rain season. It worths the 5 dollar ticket.
